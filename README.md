# AlgJulia-Book-Binder2

This is a test repo for a Binder Kernel for the Mozilla Book. 

Launch binder with this kernel using this button [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/priyaasrini/AlgJulia-Book-Binder2/HEAD)

or copy-paste this URL into your browser window - https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/priyaasrini/AlgJulia-Book-Binder2/HEAD 

If the kernel is built successfully, it will open a Jupyter-notebook in the browser window with all the packages in Project.toml and requirements.txt loaded!
